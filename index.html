            <p>The stock market is the marketplace for buying and selling of stocks and bonds of different companies. An
                investor or an individual invests in stocks to share in the ownership of that respective company stock.
                It is a way to involve the public in the company and to raise needed capital.</p>
            <p>Not everybody is familiar with the concept of the stock market. In general terms, it is an investing
                market with profits and losses. But risk of getting into this market is high with all ups and downs of
                the change in stock prices. </p>
            <p>An individual can invest in one stock or many, and it's important for the individual to understand the
                patterns of a stock market with respect to the company, its timings (year, months, days), and even which
                time of the day to invest into the stock market.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-5">
                <p>We are trying to answer common questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do news and opinions affect the stock market?</li>
                    <li>How do these patterns affect some of the top companies in the stock market?</li>
                    <li>Are stocks cyclical, and if so what days or months are the best for investors?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We identified two datasets that were suitable for our purpose. Both of the datasets were obtained from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> website, a resource for training and competitions built around data science.
                </p>
                <p>The first dataset is a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gennadiyr/us-equities-news-data">Historical News Archive</a>. This data contains news and opinion stories for the last 12 years of the US equities publicly traded on NYSE/NASDAQ which have a price higher than $10 per share. This data contains over 40,000 articles and includes the publisher, the date, and even links to the actual media. We thought that it would be interesting to look at the correlation between the number and types of stories, and the volatility of stocks. We were curious if there would be more stories before or after a sharp spike or decline in sales volume for a given stock.

                <p>Next, we found a very extensive resource on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/qks1lver/amex-nyse-nasdaq-stock-histories">AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ stocks histories</a>. We quickly discovered that the sheer magnitude of this data made it unmanageable, and we decided to explore the set using Tableau in order to find the best way to focus in and reduce the quantity. We decided on a 5 year period from 2015 to 2020. </p>
                <p>We sorted the data and determined the best 5 stocks that had a high volume of articles in the media source as well as fairly high trading volume. The decision to use volume as a comparative metric was chosen since the prices varied significantly, and trading volume seemed to be a reasonable way of normalizing the comparison. These two exploratory charts show the raw data from both sets. </p>
                <p>There is a lot of information in the raw datasets, so we created the interactive graphs below in order to facilitate further exploration of the content. It's interesting to see how the volume of opinion and news fluctuates relative to trading of the stocks.</p>
